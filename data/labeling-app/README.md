# Podcast Data Labeling App

This is a Shiny for Python data labeling app based on the [suvery form](https://shiny.posit.co/py/templates/survey/) from the Shiny for Python [templates.](https://shiny.posit.co/py/templates/)

You can use this in conjunction with a csv (the one I'm using is gitignored and not part of the repo) to create labeled versions of your data.
