# My Analysis of the Dunc'd On Basketball Podcast

Hello! So far I've created a couple of data visualizations showing:
- Nate and Danny release episodes at the wildest times of day
- A way to determine how similar or different episodes are based on embeddings from [ModernBERT](https://huggingface.co/blog/modernbert)

I may do more development on this project in the future, so if there's something you'd be interested in feel free to file an issue or post at me on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/mcmullarkey.bsky.social)
